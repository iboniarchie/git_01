## First Verse 
How doth the little crocodile  
Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile  
On every golden scale!  
How cheerfully he seems to grin ,  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
It is the color of light,  
The shape of sound high in the evergreens  
It lies suspended in hills,  
A blue line in a red sky.  
I am looking at sound.  
I am hearing the brightness  
Of high bluffs and almond trees  
I am tasting the wilderness  
of lakes, rivers, and streams  
Caught in an angle of song.  
I am remembering water  
That glows in the dawn  
The motion tumbled in earth  
Life hidden in mounds.  
I am dancing a bright beam of light  
I am remembering love.
